pry-git

_ruby aware git_

Retrieve blame, perform diffs, make commits using the natural units of
Ruby code.

pry-git enables you to diff an individual _method_ , it can show you
the blame for a method  and ultimately allow you to commit 'methods' (rather than amorphous
'hunks' of code).

pry-git is a plugin for the [pry](http://github.com/banister/pry)
REPL, a powerful IRB alternative.

pry-git is very much proof of concept right now, stay tuned!

* NOT AVAILABLE: Install the [gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/pry-git): `gem install pry-git`
* NOT AVAILABLE: Read the [documentation](http://rdoc.info/github/banister/pry-git/master/file/README.md)
* See the [source code](http://github.com/banister/pry-git)

Example: blame
--------

    pry(main)> blame Pry#repl
    John Mair   def repl(target=TOPLEVEL_BINDING)
    John Mair     target = Pry.binding_for(target)
    John Mair     target_self = target.eval('self')
    John Mair
    John Mair     repl_prologue(target)
    Mon ouÃ¯e
    John Mair     # cannot rely on nesting.level as
    John Mair     # nesting.level changes with new sessions
    John Mair     nesting_level = nesting.size
    John Mair
    John Mair     break_data = catch(:breakout) do
    John Mair       nesting.push [nesting.size, target_self, self]
    John Mair       loop do
    John Mair         rep(target)
    John Mair       end
    John Mair     end
    John Mair
    John Mair     return_value = repl_epilogue(target, nesting_level, break_data)
    Lee Jarvis    return_value || target_self
    John Mair   end

Example: diff
--------

    pry(main)> diff Pry#repl
       def repl(target=TOPLEVEL_BINDING)
    +
    +    # hey baby
         target = Pry.binding_for(target)
         target_self = target.eval('self')

    +    # bink
         repl_prologue(target)

         # cannot rely on nesting.level as
         # nesting.level changes with new sessions
         nesting_level = nesting.size

         break_data = catch(:breakout) do
           nesting.push [nesting.size, target_self, self]
           loop do
             rep(target)
           end
         end

         return_value = repl_epilogue(target, nesting_level, break_data)
         return_value || target_self
       end
    -
    -  # Perform a read-eval-print.
    -  # If no parameter is given, default to top-level (main).
